C++ Version of the Card Game Uno
Created Summer 2015  
There is a basic foundation for any card game since there are the classes card, deck and players. 
Changes will need to made in class card since this is taliored for uno (look in the ENUM type). 
The deck is a static array , while the player keeps the cards in a linked list. 
The system("clear") is environment specific and will only work in the command prompt of LINUX. 
Feel free to use the basic classes for your own card game project. :)
